# Extreme OOP

This is a run through of [this Extreme OOP worksheet][1] in Swift.

Although that worksheet recommends using a mockist TDD approach to the problem,
this currently treats the entire `Interpreter` stack as one "unit". The current
plan is to complete the exercise following this method, and then repeat it
using the mockist approach. I'll then look to compare the two solutions and
see if I can attribute the differences in the solution to the differences in
approach.
